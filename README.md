SOC Analyst Labs & Investigations

 Overview

This repository documents my hands-on learning journey as a **Junior SOC / Blue Team Analyst in training**, with a strong emphasis on understanding how **real-world Security Operations Centers (SOCs)** function in practice.

Rather than focusing on tool memorization, surface-level walkthroughs, or certification checklists, this repository is designed to demonstrate **how a SOC analyst thinks, investigates, and makes decisions under uncertainty**. Each lab is treated as a realistic security incident and approached using structured investigation and documentation methods aligned with professional SOC workflows.

The goal is to showcase analytical reasoning, investigative depth, and defensive mindset—skills that matter in real security operations.



 Core Focus Areas

The primary objectives of this repository are to build and demonstrate proficiency in the following areas:

* **Alert triage and prioritization** — determining what matters and why
* **Network and endpoint forensics** — understanding attacker behavior through evidence
* **Log and traffic analysis** — extracting insight from noisy or incomplete data
* **Incident investigation workflows** — following structured, repeatable processes
* **Evidence-based decision-making** — validating assumptions before escalating
* **Clear, structured incident documentation** — communicating findings effectively

Each investigation is documented step by step to highlight **context, reasoning, and conclusions**, not just final answers.



What You’ll Find in This Repository

This repository contains SOC-style investigations derived from realistic lab scenarios and simulated incidents, including:

* **Network-based investigations** using PCAP files
* **Web server compromise analysis**, including attack chains and exploitation techniques
* **Endpoint-focused investigations**, such as suspicious process execution and persistence analysis
* **Indicators of Compromise (IOCs)** extracted from investigations
* **Detection gaps, lessons learned, and defensive recommendations**

Where applicable, investigations also include:

* Incident timelines
* Summary reports
* Analyst notes reflecting real SOC documentation standards



 Skills Practiced and Developed

Through continuous hands-on investigation, this repository reflects active development of skills such as:

* Network traffic analysis using **Wireshark**
* Identifying malicious patterns in **HTTP, TCP, and DNS traffic**
* Detecting and investigating **reverse shells and command-and-control activity**
* Understanding attacker techniques and progression across the kill chain
* Correlating multiple data sources to validate malicious activity
* Writing **SOC-friendly documentation** that is clear, concise, and actionable
* Translating technical findings into **defensive insights and remediation guidance**



 Lab Platforms and Learning Sources

Hands-on exercises and scenarios are primarily drawn from the following platforms:

* CyberDefenders
* Blue Team Labs Online

These platforms are used to simulate real-world SOC incidents and reinforce practical, investigation-driven learning rather than passive content consumption.



 Purpose of This Repository

The purpose of this repository is to serve as both:

* A **practical learning journal**, and
* A **portfolio demonstrating SOC analyst readiness**

Each lab reflects how an analyst would handle an alert in a real SOC environment:

1. Validate whether the activity is benign or malicious
2. Gather and analyze supporting evidence
3. Determine scope and potential impact
4. Identify attacker techniques and objectives
5. Recommend containment, remediation, and detection improvements

This repository is intended to support applications for **SOC Level 1 roles, blue team internships, and entry-level cybersecurity positions**, with a particular interest in **remote and globally distributed security teams**.



Continuous Improvement and Growth

This repository is a living project and will continue to evolve over time. As my technical understanding deepens:

* New investigations will be added
* Existing labs may be revisited and improved
* Documentation quality and analytical depth will increase

This reflects the reality of cybersecurity work: **continuous learning, refinement, and adaptation**.



 Disclaimer

All investigations documented in this repository are conducted in **controlled lab environments** for educational and defensive purposes only. No real-world systems or organizations were harmed in the creation of this content.
