SOC Analyst Labs & Investigations

This repository documents my hands-on learning journey as a Junior SOC / Blue Team Analyst in training, with a strong focus on understanding how real-world security operations work in practice.

Rather than concentrating on tool memorization or certification checklists, this repository emphasizes how a SOC analyst thinks, investigates, and makes decisions under uncertainty. Each lab is approached as a realistic security incident, following structured investigation and documentation practices similar to those used in professional Security Operations Centers.



🔍 Core Focus Areas

The primary goals of this repository are to build and demonstrate skills in:

Alert triage and prioritization

Network and endpoint forensics

Log and traffic analysis

Incident investigation workflows

Evidence-based decision-making

Clear and structured incident documentation

Each investigation is documented step by step to show reasoning, context, and conclusions, not just final answers.



📂 What You’ll Find in This Repository

This repository contains SOC-style investigations derived from realistic lab scenarios, including:

Network-based investigations using PCAP files

Web server compromise and attack chain analysis

Endpoint-focused investigations and suspicious process analysis

Indicators of Compromise (IOCs) extracted from investigations

Detection gaps, lessons learned, and defensive recommendations

Where appropriate, timelines and summaries are included to reflect how incidents are handled in real SOC environments.



🧠 Skills Practiced and Developed

Through these labs, I actively practice and improve skills such as:

Network traffic analysis using Wireshark

Identifying malicious patterns in HTTP and TCP traffic

Investigating reverse shell and command-and-control activity

Analyzing attacker behavior and attack progression

Documenting findings in a clear, structured, and SOC-friendly format

Translating technical findings into defensive insights



🧪 Lab Platforms & Learning Sources

Hands-on exercises and scenarios are drawn from:

CyberDefenders

Blue Team Labs

These platforms are used to simulate real-world SOC incidents and reinforce practical investigation skills.



🛡️ Purpose of This Repository

The purpose of this repository is to demonstrate practical SOC thinking and investigative ability, not just exposure to tools. Each lab reflects how an analyst would approach an alert: validating activity, gathering evidence, determining impact, and identifying remediation steps.

This repository also serves as a personal knowledge base and portfolio as I prepare for SOC Level 1 roles and cybersecurity internships, particularly in remote and entry-level environments.



📈 Continuous Improvement

This repository will continue to grow as new labs are completed and existing investigations are refined. Older labs may be revisited and improved as my understanding deepens, reflecting continuous learning and skill development.
