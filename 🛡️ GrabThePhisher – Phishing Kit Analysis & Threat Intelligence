🛡️ GrabThePhisher – Phishing Kit Analysis & Threat Intelligence Write-Up
📌 Overview

This investigation analyzes a phishing kit designed to impersonate a decentralized exchange wallet service in order to steal cryptocurrency wallet seed phrases. The kit was hosted on a compromised server and leveraged both local logging and real-time Telegram exfiltration to capture sensitive victim data.

The objective of this analysis was to:

Identify the targeted wallet

Understand the phishing kit structure

Analyze data exfiltration methods

Extract Indicators of Compromise (IoCs)

Profile the threat actor’s operational behavior

This write-up demonstrates practical phishing analysis, threat intelligence extraction, and attacker infrastructure investigation.

🔍 Investigation Summary
🎯 Targeted Wallet

The phishing kit specifically targets MetaMask, a widely used Ethereum-compatible cryptocurrency wallet.

Evidence supporting this includes:

A dedicated metamask directory within the kit

Web pages prompting users to enter their seed phrase

Backend scripts referencing MetaMask recovery workflows

The attacker’s goal was to trick victims into “restoring” their wallets, thereby capturing full wallet access credentials.

🧪 Phishing Kit Structure
📂 Key File Identified

metamask.php

This PHP script serves as the core backend component of the phishing kit and is responsible for:

Processing form input

Capturing wallet seed phrases

Exfiltrating stolen credentials

Logging victim activity

💻 Programming Language

PHP (Hypertext Preprocessor)

PHP was used due to its server-side execution capabilities and ease of handling form submissions, logging, and API communication.

🌍 Victim Information Collection

The kit enriches stolen data by collecting victim geolocation details using the Sypex Geo API.

Data retrieved includes:

Country

Region

City (based on IP address)

This information allows attackers to:

Track victim distribution

Improve targeting

Correlate high-value victims geographically

📤 Credential Exfiltration Methods

The phishing kit uses two credential dumping mechanisms:

1️⃣ Local Logging

Stolen seed phrases are stored in log.txt

Ensures persistence even if network exfiltration fails

2️⃣ Telegram Bot Exfiltration

Credentials are sent in real time using the Telegram Bot API

Enables immediate attacker access

Leverages a legitimate service to evade detection

📊 Evidence of Compromise
🧾 Collected Seed Phrases

Total captured seed phrases: 3

Stored within log.txt
