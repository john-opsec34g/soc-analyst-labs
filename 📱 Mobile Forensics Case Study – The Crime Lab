📱 Mobile Forensics Case Study – The Crime Lab
🔍 Case Overview

This investigation focuses on the forensic analysis of an Android mobile device belonging to a homicide victim. Preliminary witness statements revealed financial distress, suspicious communications, and unexplained movements shortly before the incident.

The objective of this analysis is to reconstruct the victim’s actions, relationships, and intentions by examining digital artifacts extracted from the device.

Primary goals included:

Identifying applications linked to financial activity

Analyzing communications related to debt and threats

Determining last known location and travel intent

Correlating artifacts to establish a coherent timeline

🛠️ Tools Used

ALEAPP (Android Logs, Events, and Protobuf Parser)

Android filesystem extraction

Artifact correlation (SMS, Contacts, GPS, Chat logs)

ALEAPP was used to parse Android artifacts including installed applications, SMS messages, contacts, recent activity logs, and Discord chat data.

🧪 Analysis & Findings
Q1: Trading Application Used by the Victim

Objective:
Identify the SHA-256 hash of the trading application primarily used by the victim.

Methodology:
Using ALEAPP, the installed applications artifact was analyzed. Android applications are uniquely identified by their package name and cryptographic hash.

Findings:
A trading application with the package name:

com.ticno.olymptrade


was identified as the primary trading platform used by the victim.

SHA-256 Hash:

4f168a772350f283a1c49e78c1548d7c2c6c05106d8b9feb825fdc3466e9df3c


This confirms the application’s integrity and supports witness statements regarding the victim’s trading activities.

Q2: Amount of Money Owed by the Victim

Objective:
Determine the amount of debt referenced by the caller the victim was avoiding.

Methodology:
SMS artifacts were extracted and reviewed using ALEAPP. Android SMS databases retain message content, sender details, and timestamps.

Findings:
An SMS message from +201172137258 contained a direct repayment demand:

“Prepare the sum of 250,000 EGP… it won’t end well for you.”

Conclusion:
The victim owed 250,000 Egyptian Pounds (EGP).

Q3: Identity of the Creditor

Objective:
Identify the individual to whom the victim owed money.

Methodology:
The contacts database was parsed and cross-referenced with the sender’s phone number from the SMS evidence.

Findings:
The phone number +201172137258 corresponds to the contact:

Name: Shady Wahab

Conclusion:
The victim owed 250,000 EGP to Shady Wahab.

Q4: Victim’s Location on September 20, 2023

Objective:
Determine where the victim was located when he left home without explanation.

Methodology:
Recent activity logs and Google Maps artifacts were examined using ALEAPP.

Findings:

Google Maps was active on September 20, 2023 at 23:50:29

A snapshot showed a pinned location at:

📍 The Nile Ritz-Carlton, Cairo

Conclusion:
The victim was located at or near The Nile Ritz-Carlton, Cairo at the time he left home.

Q5: Intended Travel Destination

Objective:
Identify where the victim planned to travel after his hotel stay.

Methodology:
Discord chat logs were reviewed for travel-related communication.

Findings:
A Discord conversation with user “rob1ns0n” revealed:

A flight booked for October 1, 2023 (09:00 AM)

Reference to a meeting location: The Mob Museum

External validation confirms The Mob Museum is located in:

📍 Las Vegas, Nevada, USA

Conclusion:
The victim intended to travel to Las Vegas, Nevada.

Q6: Planned Meeting Location

Objective:
Identify where the victim planned to meet his friend.

Methodology:
Discord message content was analyzed.

Findings:
The contact explicitly stated:

“We’ll meet at The Mob Museum.”

Conclusion:
The planned meeting location was The Mob Museum, Las Vegas, Nevada.
