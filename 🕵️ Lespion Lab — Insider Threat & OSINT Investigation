🕵️ Lespion Lab — Insider Threat & OSINT Investigation

Category: Insider Threat | OSINT | Credential Exposure | Cryptojacking
Role: SOC Analyst
Difficulty: Intermediate

📌 Executive Summary

In this lab, I investigated a simulated insider-threat incident where a single user account was suspected of causing significant disruption within an organization. Initial indicators suggested misuse of company resources and potential credential exposure through public code repositories.

The objective of this investigation was to:

Identify exposed credentials and sensitive data

Trace the insider’s digital footprint

Analyze malicious tooling used

Correlate OSINT findings to assess risk and intent

The investigation leveraged OSINT techniques, GitHub repository analysis, and artifact inspection to reconstruct the attacker’s actions and assess the impact.

🎯 Investigation Objectives

Identify exposed API keys and credentials

Determine misuse of public repositories

Detect cryptomining activity

Correlate online accounts using OSINT

Attribute actions to a single insider account

🧰 Tools & Techniques Used

GitHub repository analysis

Commit history review

Base64 decoding

OSINT investigation

Sherlock (username enumeration)

Google Image Reverse Search

Metadata and artifact analysis

🔍 Investigation Walkthrough
Q1: What API key did the insider expose on GitHub?

Finding:
During analysis of the GitHub profile EMarseille99, a public repository named:

Project-Build---Custom-Login-Page


was reviewed. Examination of the commit history revealed that the file Login Page.js contained a hardcoded API key:

aJFRaLHjMXvYZgLPwiJkroYLGRkNBW


Security Impact:
Hardcoding API keys in public repositories exposes backend services to unauthorized access and is a critical security failure.

Q2: What plaintext password was exposed?

Within the same repository, the login logic contained a Base64-encoded password:

UGljYXNzb0JhZ3VldHRlOTk=


After decoding, the plaintext password was identified as:

PicassoBaguette99


Security Impact:

Base64 encoding ≠ encryption

Indicates poor security hygiene

High likelihood of password reuse across systems

Immediate remediation would require password rotation and access review.

Q3: What cryptocurrency mining tool was used?

The insider’s GitHub profile contained a fork of XMRig.

Tool Identified:

XMRig (Monero Miner)


Risk Assessment:
XMRig is commonly abused in cryptojacking attacks to covertly mine Monero using victim resources. Its presence strongly suggests unauthorized resource exploitation.

Q4: What gaming platform account did the insider have?

Using Sherlock OSINT, the username EMarseille99 was queried across multiple platforms.

Confirmed Account:

Steam Community

https://steamcommunity.com/id/EMarseille99/


This account may serve as an OSINT pivot for social connections or behavioral correlation.

Q5: What is the insider’s Instagram profile?

Identified via Sherlock output:

https://www.instagram.com/EMarseille99/

Q6: Where did the insider travel for holiday?

Instagram activity indicated recent travel to:

Singapore

Q7: Where does the insider’s family live?

Multiple uploaded images geotagged to:

Dubai

Q8: Where is the company office located?

Using reverse image search on office.jpg, the building was identified as being located in:

Birmingham

Q9: In which U.S. state was the IP camera located?

Reverse image search on Webcam.png showed landmarks associated with:

Indiana

🧠 Key Findings

Insider exposed API keys and passwords in public repositories

Poor credential handling and insecure coding practices

Evidence of cryptocurrency mining activity

Extensive online footprint discoverable via OSINT

Insider risk amplified by lack of repository monitoring

🛡️ Defensive Recommendations

Enforce secret scanning on all repositories

Prohibit hardcoded credentials

Monitor public GitHub repos linked to employees

Implement insider-threat detection policies

Audit endpoint usage for cryptomining behavior

Enforce secure coding standards and peer review

📈 Lessons Learned

Public repositories are a high-risk attack surface

OSINT is critical in insider-threat investigations

Credential exposure often precedes larger incidents

SOC analysts must correlate technical and behavioral data
