# Detection Gaps & Recommendations

## Observed Gaps
- Weak file upload validation
- Executable files allowed in upload directory
- No alerting on outbound reverse shell traffic

## Recommendations
- Enforce strict MIME and extension validation
- Disable execution in upload directories
- Monitor outbound connections on non-standard ports
